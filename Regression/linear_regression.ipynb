    "# Model Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression model was fitted to predict the **Performance Index** based on several predictors. Below is an interpretation of the intercept and each coefficient in the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intercept\n",
    "- **Intercept:** -34.121  \n",
    "  This value represents the estimated **Performance Index** when all predictor variables are equal to zero. In this context, a negative intercept suggests that if a student had zero hours studied, zero previous scores, did not participate in extracurricular activities, got zero sleep hours, and practiced zero sample question papers, the model predicts a very low (or negative) performance index. While this scenario is unlikely, the intercept serves as a baseline for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coefficients\n",
    "Each coefficient quantifies the expected change in the **Performance Index** for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hours Studied:** 2.852  \n",
    "  For each additional hour a student studies, the **Performance Index** is predicted to increase by approximately 2.85 units. This indicates a strong positive relationship between study time and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Previous Scores:** 1.019  \n",
    "  An increase of one unit in previous scores is associated with an increase of about 1.02 units in the **Performance Index**. This suggests that a student's past academic performance is a valuable predictor of future performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extracurricular Activities:** 0.749  \n",
    "  Since the **Extracurricular Activities** variable was converted to numeric (with 1 representing \"yes\" and 0 representing \"no\"), this coefficient indicates that students who participate in extracurricular activities have a **Performance Index** that is, on average, 0.75 units higher than those who do not, all else being equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sleep Hours:** 0.467  \n",
    "  Each additional hour of sleep is associated with an increase of approximately 0.47 units in the **Performance Index**. Although this effect is positive, it is smaller compared to other predictors, suggesting that sleep has a more modest impact on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Question Papers Practiced:** 0.199  \n",
    "  For every additional sample question paper practiced, the **Performance Index** increases by about 0.20 units. This indicates a positive, but relatively minor, effect on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Interpretation\n",
    "The model highlights the importance of study-related activities and previous academic performance in predicting the **Performance Index**. Notably, **Hours Studied** and **Previous Scores** have the most significant impacts, as evidenced by their higher coefficients. While factors like **Extracurricular Activities**, **Sleep Hours**, and **Sample Question Papers Practiced** also contribute positively, their effects are comparatively smaller. This insight can be useful for educators and students alike, suggesting that focusing on study time and building on past performance may yield the most substantial improvements in overall academic outcomes.\n"
